I am a PhD candidate at the [Department of Economics](https://www.economics.harvard.edu/) at Harvard University (expected to graduate in May 2025). I will join [Cornerstone Research](https://www.cornerstone.com/) in July 2025. 

I am specializing in Industrial Organization and International Trade. My research centers around technology innovation and market structure in the container shipping industry. I also work on topics related to supply chain disruption.

I previously worked as:

- Summer associate at Cornerstone Research
- Economics/Research Scientist intern at Flexport
- Gap-year analyst at Goldman Sachs Global Investment Research

## Research

[1. How Big Is Too Big?: The Competitive Effects of Shipping Technology Innovation](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/7hneeza5ykba01z552b6q/large_boat_thesis.pdf?rlkey=sfi9mqxnxpdoo85rjbtqhut97&st=g91wwgna&dl=0)

Technological innovation drives economic progress but can also lead to unintended
consequences, such as market over-consolidation. This paper examines the competitive
effects of technological advancement in the container shipping industry, focusing on the
relationship between vessel size and market structure, and its impact on welfare. Using
a dynamic oligopoly model and proprietary data, we quantify the economies of scale
associated with vessel size and explore how it interact with market competition and
investment behavior. We find that a 10% increase in vessel size reduces operational
costs by 3.4% but contributes to market concentration, potentially offsetting consumer
benefits. Counterfactual analysis suggests that the welfare-optimal vessel size is around
20,000 TEU under current demand level, as larger vessels risk over-consolidating the
market. Additionally, smaller innovation steps promote competition, while larger steps
drive consolidation. These findings highlight the need for policymakers to balance the
efficiency gains of technological advancements with their competitive impacts, particularly
when designing infrastructure investments in industries with strong economies
of scale.
