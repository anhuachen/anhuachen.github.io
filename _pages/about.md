I am a PhD candidate at the [Department of Economics](https://www.economics.harvard.edu/) at Harvard University (expected to graduate in May 2025). I will join [Cornerstone Research](https://www.cornerstone.com/) in July 2025. 

I am specializing in Industrial Organization and International Trade. My research centers around technology innovation and market structure in the container shipping industry. I also work on topics related to supply chain disruption.

I previously worked as:

- Summer associate at Cornerstone Research
- Economics/Research Scientist intern at Flexport
- Gap-year analyst at Goldman Sachs Global Investment Research
